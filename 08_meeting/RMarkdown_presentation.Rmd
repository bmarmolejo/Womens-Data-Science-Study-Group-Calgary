```

The `rmarkdown` package is a relatively complete ecosystem for authoring documents.
The tasks that you could do with R Markdown are:

* Compile a single R Markdown document to a report in different formats, such as PDF, HTML, or Word.
* Create notebooks in which you can directly run code chunks interactively.
* Make slides for presentations (HTML5, LaTeX Beamer, or PowerPoint).
* Produce dashboards with flexible, interactive, and attractive layouts.
* Build interactive applications based on Shiny.
* Write journal articles.
* Author books of multiple chapters.
* Generate websites and blogs.


## Document Metadata

The body of a document follows the metadata. 

* The syntax for text (also known as prose or narratives) is Markdown. 
* Two types of computer code
  - R code chunks and inline R code
  
### Markdown Syntax

You can write your report in plain text. 

* _Italic_ is surrounded by underscores or asterisks, e.g., ```_text_``` or ```*text*```. 
* **Bold** the text by using a pair of double asterisks (```**text**```)
* To subscript the text uses a pair of tildes (~) (e.g., ```H~2~O``` renders H~2~O). 
* To superscript uses a pair of carets (^) (e.g., ```Cu^2+^``` renders Cu^2+^).
* Hyperlinks ```[text](link)```, e.g., ```[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com)```
* Images: just add an exclamation mark, e.g., ```![alt text or image title](path/to/image)```. 
* Footnotes: put inside the square brackets after a caret ```^[]```, e.g., ```^[This is a footnote.]```.

Section headers:

```# First-level header```

```## Second-level header```

```### Third-level header```


# First-level header

## Second-level header

### Third-level header


Unordered list:

The items start with *, -, or +, and it  can be nested one list within another list by indenting the sub-list

```
- one item
- one item
- one item
    - one more item
    - one more item
    - one more item
```

- one item
- one item
- one item
    - one more item
    - one more item
    - one more item


Ordered list:

The items start with numbers (you can also nest lists within lists)
```
1. the first item
2. the second item
3. the third item
    - one unordered item
    - one unordered item
```

1. the first item
2. the second item
3. the third item
    - one unordered item
    - one unordered item
    

### R code chunks and inline R code

To insert an R code chunk you can either use the RStudio toolbar (the Insert button) or the keyboard shortcut ```Ctrl + Alt + I``` (```Cmd + Option + I``` on macOS).

In a code chunk you can produce text output, tables, or graphics and you have control over all these output via chunk options, which can be provided inside the curly braces (between ``` ```{r and }```).



## Plots

```{r package_options, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# All defaults
ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) + geom_line()
```

```{r}
tail(mtcars)
```

```{r out.width = "50%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) + geom_point()
```

```{r}
plot <- ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), color="black", fill = "steelblue", binwidth = 0.5, alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_density()
plot
```

## Tables

To work with tables, we can use the libraries

```
install.packages("kableExtra")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```

Let's use the mtcars dataset available in R
```{r}
dt <- mtcars[1:7, 1:6]
dt
```

The basic HTML output of `kable`.

```{r}
kable(dt)
```

The HTML table using the `kable_styling()` apply twitter bootstrap theme to the table.

```{r}
dt %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

There are some predefined classes that you can use as `striped`, `bordered`, `hover`, `condensed`, and `responsive`.

```{r}
kable(dt) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

For shorter row height, you can use the option `condensed`.

```{r}
kable(dt) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```


For more examples of how to manipulate table styles [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html)


#Interactive plots


```{r}
library(plotly)
p <- plot_ly(midwest, x = ~percollege, color = ~state, type = "box")
p
```
```{r}
head(economics)
```




```{r}
plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = ~unemploy / pop)

```

```{r}
plot_ly(economics, 
        x = ~date,
        y = ~unemploy, 
        type = 'scatter', 
        mode = 'lines') %>%
layout(title = "Unemploy") 
```
# Arranging plotly objects

The `subplot()` function provides a flexible interface for merging multiple plotly objects into a single object. 


```{r}
p1 <- plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = ~unemploy) %>% 
  add_lines(name = "unemploy")
p2 <- plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = ~uempmed) %>% 
  add_lines(name = "uempmed")
subplot(p1, p2)
```

When we are evaluating time series on diferent y scale and common x scale, we also use the `subplot` function.

```{r}
vars <- setdiff(names(economics), "date")
plots <- lapply(vars, function(var) {
  plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = as.formula(paste0("~", var))) %>%
    add_lines(name = var)
})
subplot(plots, nrows = length(plots), shareX = TRUE, titleX = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(gapminder)
head(gapminder)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 9, fig.align = "center",  warning=FALSE}

gapminder %>%
    plot_ly(x = ~gdpPercap, y = ~lifeExp, size = ~pop) %>%
    add_markers(color = ~continent, frame = ~year, ids = ~country) %>%
    layout(xaxis = list(type = "log"))
```


Now, it is your turn to create a beatiful HTML document in Rmarkown. 
Use one of the datasets from the last meeting and please, includes:

* Image
* GIF
* text
* plots
* tables
* hyperlinks
* Titles
* Other things you want
