Today, we will start creating beautiful visualization with R.


## Load the `tidyverse` package
First, let's load the tidyverse library, using the command `library(tidyverse)`:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data manipulation with`dplyr`
To manage data frames, we will use the `dplyr` library, already downloaded with `tidyverse`.

### `dplyr` Grammar
Some of the key "verbs" provided by the `dplyr` package are

* `select`: return a subset of the columns of a data frame, using a flexible notation
* `filter`: extract a subset of rows from a data frame based on logical conditions
* `arrange`: reorder rows of a data frame
* `rename`: rename variables in a data frame
* `mutate`: add new variables/columns or transform existing variables
* `summarise` / `summarize`: generate summary statistics of different variables in the data frame, possibly within strata
* `%>%`: the "pipe" operator is used to connect multiple verb actions together into a pipeline

To present the next examples, we will be using a dataset containing air pollution and temperature data for the city of Chicago in the U.S.

```{r}
chicago <- readRDS("chicago.rds")
```
```{r}
dim(chicago)
str(chicago)
```

### `select()`

The `select()` function can be used to select columns of a data frame. 

Suppose we wanted to take the first 3 columns only. There are a few ways to do this. We could for example use numerical indices. But we can also use the names directly.

```{r}
names(chicago)[1:3]
```
```{r}
subset <- select(chicago, city:dptp)
head(subset)
```

You can also omit variables using the `select()` function by using the negative sign. 

```{r}
subset_omit <- select(chicago, -(city:dptp))
head(subset_omit)
```

The `select()` function also allows a special syntax that allows you to specify variable names based on patterns. 

To keep every variable that ends with a "2", we could do
```{r}
subset_vars_end2 <- select(chicago, ends_with("2"))
str(subset_vars_end2)
```

To keep every variable that starts with a "d", we could do
```{r}
subset_vars_startd <- select(chicago, starts_with("d"))
str(subset_vars_startd)
```

### filter()

The `filter()` function is used to extract subsets of rows from a data frame. This function is similar to the existing `subset()` function in R but is quite a bit faster.

Suppose we wanted to extract the rows of the chicago data frame where the levels of PM2.5 are greater than 30 (which is a reasonably high level), we could do

```{r}
chic.f <- filter(chicago, pm25tmean2 > 30)
str(chic.f)
```

```{r}
summary(chic.f$pm25tmean2)
```

We can place an arbitrarily complex logical sequence inside of `filter()`, so we could for example extract the rows where PM2.5 is greater than 30 and temperature is greater than 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

```{r}
chic.f <- filter(chicago, pm25tmean2 > 30 & tmpd > 80)
select(chic.f, date, tmpd, pm25tmean2)
```


### `arrange()`

The `arrange()` function is used to reorder rows of a data frame according to one of the variables/columns. 

We can order the rows of the data frame by date, so that the first row is the earliest (oldest) observation and the last row is the latest (most recent) observation.

```{r}
head(chicago, 10)
```

```{r}
chicago <- arrange(chicago, date)
```

We can now check the first few rows
```{r}
head(select(chicago, date, pm25tmean2), 3)
```

and the last few rows.
```{r}
tail(select(chicago, date, pm25tmean2), 3)
```

Columns can be arranged in descending order too by using the special `desc()` operator.
```{r}
chicago <- arrange(chicago, desc(date))
```

Looking at the first three and last three rows shows the dates in descending order.
```{r}
head(select(chicago, date, pm25tmean2), 3)
```

```{r}
tail(select(chicago, date, pm25tmean2), 3)
```

### `rename()`

The `rename()` function is designed to rename a variable in a data frame.

Here you can see the names of the first five variables in the chicago data frame.

```{r}
head(chicago[, 1:5], 3)
```
The dptp column is supposed to represent the dew point temperature and the pm25tmean2 column provides the PM2.5 data. However, these names are pretty obscure or awkward and probably be renamed to something more sensible.

```{r}
chicago <- rename(chicago, dewpoint = dptp, pm25 = pm25tmean2)
head(chicago[, 1:5], 3)
```

The syntax inside the `rename()` function is to have the new name on the left-hand side of the = sign and the old name on the right-hand side.

### `mutate()`

The `mutate()` function exists to compute transformations of variables in a data frame. 

For example, with air pollution data, we often want to detrend the data by subtracting the mean from the data. That way we can look at whether a given day's air pollution level is higher than or less than average (as opposed to looking at its absolute level).

Here we create a pm25detrend variable that subtracts the mean from the pm25 variable.

```{r}
chicago <- mutate(chicago, pm25detrend = pm25 - mean(pm25, na.rm = TRUE))
head(chicago)
```


### `group_by()`

The `group_by()` function is used to generate summary statistics from the data frame within strata defined by a variable. For example, in this air pollution dataset, you might want to know what the average annual level of PM2.5 is. So the stratum is the year, and that is something we can derive from the date variable. In conjunction with the `group_by()` function we often use the `summarize()` function.

The general operation here is a combination of splitting a data frame into separate pieces defined by a variable or group of variables (`group_by()`), and then applying a summary function across those subsets (`summarize()`).

First, we can create a year varible using `as.POSIXlt()`.

```{r}
chicago <- mutate(chicago, year = as.POSIXlt(date)$year + 1900)
head(chicago)
```

Now we can create a separate data frame that splits the original data frame by year.

```{r}
years <- group_by(chicago, year)
```

Finally, we compute summary statistics for each year in the data frame with the `summarize()` function.

```{r}
summarize(years, pm25 = mean(pm25, na.rm = TRUE), 
           o3 = max(o3tmean2, na.rm = TRUE), 
           no2 = median(no2tmean2, na.rm = TRUE))
```

In a slightly more complicated example, we might want to know what are the average levels of ozone (o3) and nitrogen dioxide (no2) within quintiles of pm25. A slicker way to do this would be through a regression model, but we can actually do this quickly with `group_by()` and `summarize()`.

First, we can create a categorical variable of pm25 divided into quintiles.

```{r}
qq <- quantile(chicago$pm25, seq(0, 1, 0.2), na.rm = TRUE)
chicago <- mutate(chicago, pm25.quint = cut(pm25, qq))
head(chicago)
```

Now we can group the data frame by the pm25.quint variable.

```{r}
quint <- group_by(chicago, pm25.quint)
head(quint)
```

Finally, we can compute the mean of o3 and no2 within quintiles of pm25.

```{r}
summarize(quint, o3 = mean(o3tmean2, na.rm = TRUE), 
           no2 = mean(no2tmean2, na.rm = TRUE))
```

From the table, it seems there isn't a strong relationship between pm25 and o3, but there appears to be a positive correlation between pm25 and no2. More sophisticated statistical modeling can help to provide precise answers to these questions, but a simple application of `dplyr` functions can often get you most of the way there.

### `%>%`

The pipeline operater `%>%` is very handy for stringing together multiple `dplyr` functions in a sequence of operations. Notice above that every time we wanted to apply more than one function, the sequence gets buried in a sequence of nested function calls that is difficult to read, i.e.

```
third(second(first(x)))
```

This nesting is not a natural way to think about a sequence of operations. The `%>%` operator allows you to string operations in a left-to-right fashion, i.e.

```
first(x) %>% second %>% third
```

Take the example that we just did in the last section where we computed the mean of o3 and no2 within quintiles of pm25. There we had to

1. create a new variable pm25.quint
2. split the data frame by that new variable
3. compute the mean of o3 and no2 in the sub-groups defined by pm25.quint

That can be done with the following sequence in a single R expression.

```{r}
mutate(chicago, pm25.quint = cut(pm25, qq)) %>%    
         group_by(pm25.quint) %>% 
         summarize(o3 = mean(o3tmean2, na.rm = TRUE), 
                   no2 = mean(no2tmean2, na.rm = TRUE))
```

This way we don't have to create a set of temporary variables along the way or create a massive nested sequence of function calls.

Notice in the above code that we pass the chicago data frame to the first call to `mutate()`, but then afterwards we do not have to pass the first argument to `group_by()` or `summarize()`. Once you travel down the pipeline with `%>%`, the first argument is taken to be the output of the previous element in the pipeline.

Another example might be computing the average pollutant level by month. This could be useful to see if there are any seasonal trends in the data.

```{r}
mutate(chicago, month = as.POSIXlt(date)$mon + 1) %>% 
         group_by(month) %>% 
         summarize(pm25 = mean(pm25, na.rm = TRUE), 
                   o3 = max(o3tmean2, na.rm = TRUE), 
                   no2 = median(no2tmean2, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Here we can see that o3 tends to be low in the winter months and high in the summer while no2 is higher in the winter and lower in the summer.


## Working with `ggplot2`

The package `ggplot2` is also available with the `tidyverse` library
```{r}
head(chicago)
```
## Histogram

To summarize continuous variable using a series of bars, we need to divide the observations into groups, or bins, and count how many are in each one. 

By default, the `geom_histogram()` function will choose a bin size for us based on a rule of thumb.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = chicago,
            mapping = aes(x = pm25))
p + geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = chicago,
            mapping = aes(x = pm25))
p + geom_histogram(bins = 10)
```


Change line color and fill color

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = chicago, 
            mapping = aes(x=pm25)) +
  geom_histogram(color="darkblue", fill="lightblue")
p
```

Change line type
```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = chicago, 
            mapping = aes(x=pm25)) +
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="lightblue",
                 linetype="dashed")
p
``` 

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = chicago, 
            mapping = aes(x=pm25)) +
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="pink",
                 linetype="dashed") +
  labs(title="PM2.5 histogram plot",x="PM2.5", y = "Count")+
  theme_classic()
p
``` 



It's also possible to use several at once to compare distributions. We can facet histograms by some variable of interest, or as here we can compare them in the same plot using the fill mapping.

```{r}
pm25.quint_ <- unique(na.omit(chicago$pm25.quint))
pm25.quint_
```
```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = subset(chicago, subset = pm25.quint %in% pm25.quint_),
            mapping = aes(x = dewpoint, fill = pm25.quint))
p + geom_histogram(alpha = 0.4, bins = 30)
```

When working with a continuous variable, an alternative to binning the data and making a histogram is to calculate a kernel density estimate of the underlying distribution. The `geom_density()` function will do this for us.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = subset(chicago, subset = pm25.quint %in% pm25.quint_),
            mapping = aes(x = dewpoint, fill = pm25.quint, color = pm25.quint))
p + geom_density(alpha = 0.3)
```
